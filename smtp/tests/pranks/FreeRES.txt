Subject: Free RES/API
Dear Students,

The board of directors of the HEIG-VD has come to the conclusion that all of the students of this class are way to beautiful, smart and awesome for you to waste your time learning things.

Hence, the decision has been made that all of you will be accorded a final grade of 6 on this module. You can now take your free time and do something unproductive with it, you deserved it.

Best regards,
JÃ¼rgen Ehrensberger
